            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Firsrt generation Mexican-American, born in Reno, Nv and relocated to Dallas, Tx. Majority of my work experience comes from the service industry. I held postions such as Bar Manager, Lead Bartender and Assistant General Manager for several restaurants. My transition into IT was brought on by a need for a more stable and secure career with flexibility. Since I dedicate so much time and effort into my work, I like to keep a balance with an exciting home life. Some of my hobbies include mixed martial arts, heavy metal concerts and learning how to tattoo. I am also a proud father of two cats, Solita and Luna.
